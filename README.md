# suricata-idps-project
## Overview

This project deploys **Suricata** as an **IDPS** to detect and block attacks generated from an attacker machine (Kali) against a vulnerable target (Metasploitable).  
The goal is to understand how Suricata works, including:

- IDS and IPS modes  
- Suricata architecture  
- Configuration files  
- ET (Emerging Threats) rules  
- Custom rule creation  
- Alert and drop analysis  

This environment provides a clear introduction to intrusion detection and prevention.
