# suricata-idps-project
# Overview
This project consists of deploying Suricata as an IDPS to detect and block attacks generated from an attacker machine (Kali) against a vulnerable target (Metasploitable).
The goal is to understand how Suricata works, including:
its architecture
IDS and IPS modes
configuration files
using ET (Emerging Threats) rules
creating custom rules
analyzing alerts and dropped packets
This setup helps build a clear understanding of intrusion detection and prevention in a controlled lab environment.
